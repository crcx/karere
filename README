Karere
---------------------------------------------------------------
This is a family of applications that provide IM over email.

How it works (user perspective):

 - Run this code on your computer
 - Each IM gets sent to you as an email
 - Send email to a specific address to reply or start
   a conversation
   - Subject = destination
   - Body = message

Karere acts as a specialized client that translates between
IM protocols and email.
---------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements:

  - Email account (to recieve messages from server)
  - Email account (to send messages to server)
  - These must be separate accounts. Do not use the sender
    account for anything else.

  - PHP 5
    - With IMAP and socket extensions
    - With working mail() function

This is only tested on Linux and OS X systems at present.
