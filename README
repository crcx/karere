Karere
---------------------------------------------------------------
This is a set of programs that provide access to IRC via any
email client.
---------------------------------------------------------------
How it Works:

  1) IRC bot
     a) Watches a channel for messages, forwarding any
        messages to a specific email address
     b) Monitors a specific file
     c) When the file contents change, post the contents
        as a message to the channel
  2) Email handler
     a) Checks an imap email account (gmail)
     b) Update a specific file with the subject of any
        recieved message
     c) Should be set to run on a regular interval
---------------------------------------------------------------
The split of Karere into two parts was done to make deployment
less troublesome for me.

Specifically, I have a VPS (virtual private server) which I
use for some of my web hosting and email needs. This allows me
to run custom apps, but doesn't permit IRC access.

I run the email side on the server, with a set of cron jobs
that check a specific mailbox every 30 seconds. Any messages
get placed in a specific file on one of my domains.

The irc bot runs on another machine, which does have IRC
access, but doesn't provide email reciept (it is configured
to forward my email to another account). I could also run the
irc bot on my local machine if the need arises.

The split will also be beneficial as it permits multiple
accounts, one per bot, and allows for a distributed load
across multiple servers.
